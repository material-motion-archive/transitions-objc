## Supported languages

- Swift 3
- Objective-C

## Features

This library makes it possible to create UIViewController transitions using the Material Motion
runtime.

## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

> CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift libraries. CocoaPods automates the
> process of using third-party libraries in your projects. See
> [the Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for more
> information. You can install it with the following command:
>
>     gem install cocoapods

Add `MaterialMotionTransitions` to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'MaterialMotionTransitions'

Then run the following command:

    pod install

### Usage

Import the framework:

    @import MaterialMotionTransitions;

You will now have access to all of the APIs.

## Example apps/unit tests

Check out a local copy of the repo to accessÂ the Catalog application by running the following
commands:

    git clone https://github.com/material-motion/transitions-objc.git
    cd transitions-objc
    pod install
    open MaterialMotionTransitions.xcworkspace

## Architecture

The core aspects of this library consist of the following:

- The TransitionDirector protocol
- The TransitionController object

An object conforming to TransitionDirector is able to describe the plans that should occur during
a UIViewController transition.

TransitionController is what allows you to decide which TransitionDirector should govern a
particular transition.

## How to create a transition director

Transition directors govern both the presentation and dismissal of a given view controller. An
instance of a director is created each time a transition is initiated and thrown away upon the
transition's completion.

### Step 1: Create a new class that conforms to TransitionDirector

Be sure to store the provided MDMTransition object.

Code snippets:

***In Objective-C:***

```objc
@interface <# DirectorName #>TransitionDirector : NSObject <MDMTransitionDirector>
@end

@interface <# DirectorName #>TransitionDirector ()
@property(nonatomic, strong) MDMTransition *transition;
@end

@implementation <# DirectorName #>TransitionDirector

- (instancetype)initWithTransition:(MDMTransition *)transition {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    _transition = transition;
  }
  return self;
}

- (void)setUp {
}

@end
```

***In Swift:***

```swift
class <# DirectorName #>TransitionDirector: NSObject, TransitionDirector {

  let transition: Transition
  required init(transition: Transition) {
    self.transition = transition
  }

  func setUp() {
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Register motion in setUp

Register plans using the transition object's runtime.

Code snippets:

***In Objective-C:***

```objc
- (void)setUp {
  [self.transition.runtime addPlan:<#(nonnull NSObject<MDMPlan> *)#> to:<#(nonnull id)#>];
}
```

***In Swift:***

```swift
func setUp() {
  transition.runtime.addPlan(<#T##plan: Plan##Plan#>, to: <#T##Any#>)
}
```

### How to use a director for a view controller transition

Every view controller has an associated `mdm_transitionController` instance. Set a
TransitionDirector class type on the `directorClass` property. When you present the view controller,
an instance of your TransitionDirector class will be created and its `setUp` method will be invoked.

Code snippets:

***In Objective-C:***

```objc
<#(nonnull UIViewController *)#>.mdm_transitionController.directorClass = [<# TransitionDirector #>TransitionDirector class];
[self presentViewController:<#(nonnull UIViewController *)#> animated:<#(BOOL)#> completion:<#^(void)completion#>];
```

***In Swift:***

```swift
<# UIViewController instance #>.mdm_transitionController.directorClass = <# TransitionDirector #>TransitionDirector.self
present(<#T##viewControllerToPresent: UIViewController##UIViewController#>, animated: <#T##Bool#>)
```
